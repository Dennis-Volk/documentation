= PocketNet Core Node Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to setup a compute node to support the PocketNet blockchain network and Bastyon decentralized social media app.PocketNet Core Node operators are rewarded in the platform cryptocurrency, PKOIN, by participating in a process called staking which generates new blocks on the blockchain.
More detail about the PocketNet network can be found in the whitepaper here: https://pocketnet.app/docs/Pocketnet%20Whitepaper%20Draft%20v2.pdf
And at the Bastyon social media site at bastyon.com

== Suported Operating Systems
The below operating systems have been validated to work with PocketNet Core software by the developer and node operator community:

    Docker
    Linux Debian 11
    Linux Mint
    Linux Ubuntu 20.04
    Linux Ubuntu 18.04
    Windows 10
    Windows 11


== Minimum System Requirements
Below are the minimum system requirements to run a PocketNet node to use as a wallet, for coin staking to earn PKOIN, and to use as a local node on your home network.  A node with these requirements may need to be upgraded within the next 1 - 2 years.

    2 core x86-64 CPU
    4GB RAM
    100 GB harddrive
    10 Mbps internet connection

== Recommended System Requirements
The below recommended system requirements are recommended for a node which will act as a public node to service the Bastyon front end, in addition to wallet and coin staking abilities.  The recommended requirements should provide enough headroom to support the Pocketnet network for at least 2 years into the future.

    4 core x86-64 CPU
    16 GB RAM
    500 GB SSD Harddrive
    100 Mbps internet connection
    Publically accessible IP address and ports (see Network Setup below)

== Linux Getting Started  (Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, etc.)

Download the latest pocketnetcore_*_linux_x64_setup package from the project releases page at: https://github.com/pocketnetteam/pocketnet.core/releases

Install package with root privilegies. To do this, open the terminal in the directory where you downloaded the installer and execute commands:

[source]
----
$ sudo dpkg -i pocketnetcore_*_linux_x64_setup.deb
----

Download and copy the checkpoints file from the repository to the .pocketcoin/checkpoints directory (example below for version v0.20.17):

[source]
----
mkdir ~/.pocketcoin
mkdir ~/.pocketcoin/checkpoints
cd ~/.pocketcoin/checkpoints
wget https://github.com/pocketnetteam/pocketnet.core/releases/download/v0.20.17/main.sqlite3
cd ~
----


After installation, start the GUI pocketcoin client from the command line.  If you would like to run the pocketcoin node from the command line or in headless mode, go to the "Running a Headless Node from the Command Line" section below.

[source]
----
$ pocketcoin-qt
----
At this point the Pocketcoin client will start synchornizing with the network.  Depending on network performance full synchronization can take anywhere from a few days to over a week to complete.  If it is necessary to bring a node up in a short period of time, it is possible to download a checkpoint following the instructions in the "Starting from Checkpoint" section below.  However it is recommended to allow a node to synchronize with the network on it's own as this validates the public block chain and provides additional security and decentralization.

If it is desired to run a full node to support the Bastyon front-end app, proceed to the Network Setup section below.

== Windows Getting Started

Download the pocketnetcore_*_win_x64_setup.exe installer and the main.sqlite3 file from the GitHub releases page here: https://github.com/pocketnetteam/pocketnet.core/releases

Run the installer.

Before starting the PocketNet app for the first time, download the file for the main.sqlite3 file from the releases page: 

The main.sqlite3 file must be copied into the checkpoints folder in the default Pocketcoin data directory, which typically is in the folder %APPDATA%\Pocketcoin\checkpoints.
Below are example commands to copy the file into the correct folder, assuming the main.sqlite3 file was downloaded to the folder %HOMEPATH%\Downloads:

[source]
----
cd %APPDATA%
mkdir Pocketcoin
cd Pocketcoin
mkdir checkpoints
copy %HOMEPATH%\Downloads\main.sqlite3 %APPDATA%\Pocketcoin\checkpoints\main.sqlite3
----

Start the Pocketcoin Core application from the Windows Start menu.  A Windows Security Alert will pop up for Windows Defender Firewall. Select "Allow access" to allow PocketNet Core through the Windows Defender Firewall for Private networks.

At this point the Pocketcoin client will start synchornizing with the network.  Depending on network performance full synchronization can take anywhere from a few days to over a week to complete.  If it is necessary to bring a node up in a short period of time, it is possible to download a checkpoint following the instructions in the "Starting from Checkpoint" section below.  However it is recommended to allow a node to synchronize with the network on it's own as this validates the public block chain and provides additional security and decentralization.

== Docker Setup

Make sure that enough CPU, memory and disk space are allocated to your Docker container according to the "Minimum System Requirements" section above.
You can start your node with a single command from Docker.

[source,shell]
----
$ docker run -d \
    --name=pocketnet.main \
    -p 37070:37070 \
    -p 38081:38081 \
    -p 8087:8087 \
    -v /var/pocketnet/.data:/home/pocketcoin/.pocketcoin \
    pocketnetteam/pocketnet.core:latest
----
The node can be controlled in Docker using the pocketcoin-cli and pocketcoin-tx commands demonstrated below:

[source]
----
$ docker ps --format '{{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}'
ea7759a47250    pocketnet.main      pocketnetteam/pocketnet.core:latest
$
$ docker exec -it pocketnet.main /bin/sh
$
$ pocketcoin-cli --help
$ pocketcoin-tx --help
----

== Network Setup

In order for your node to receive incoming connections from the Bastyon front end and other nodes on the network, the following ports must be open on your node: 8087, 37070, and 38081.
On home networks, enabling port forwarding is specific to your brand of internet router.For routers that support it, mapping to a different port should *not* be used, i.e. port external port 38081 should map to internal port 38081 on the router.Below are links to instructions for some popular router models:

== Running a Headless Node From the Command Line

[TODO]

[TODO pocketcoin-cli]

== Getting Started with Staking

Staking is the process where your node works to generate new blocks on the PocketNet blockchain, and in return is rewarded with PKOIN awards.  New blocks are generated on the PocketNet blockchain every 1 minute, and 5 PKOIN is awarded to a winning node each round.  A stake reward halving occurs every 2 million blocks, the first on the PocketNet network will occur around October of 2022, after which the stake reward will be reduced to 2.5 coins per block.
To participate in staking, you must deposit at least 50 PKOIN to your node wallet address and ensure.  The more PKOIN desposited to your wallet address, the better your chances of winning a stake round, up to a cap of 10000 PKOIN.

Running the "getstakinginfo" command from pocketcoin-cli or the debug window of Pocketcoin-qt will tell you if your node is staking, for example:

[source]
----
ubuntu@ip-172-31-53-18:~/.pocketcoin$ pocketcoin-cli getstakinginfo
{
  "enabled": true,
  "staking": true,
  "errors": "",
  "currentblockweight": 63528,
  "currentblocktx": 52,
  "difficulty": 228206.0349124698,
  "search-interval": 16,
  "weight": 2305157068183,
  "balance": 2305157068183,
  "netstakeweight": 272146840647277,
  "expectedtime": 17708
}
----

If the "enabled" and "staking" fields are set to "true" the node is actively staking.  The "expectedtime" field above gives the estimated time in seconds until the next stake win.  Stake wins are based on chance and can be highly variable.  The first time a node is setup for staking, it may take several hours for the "enabled" and "staking" fields to show up as "true".

== Starting Node from a Blockchain Snapshot

It is recommended to allow a PocketNet Core node to sync with the blockchain on it's own to maximize network security and decentralization.If it is desired to bring up a node in a short amount of time, the development team provides periodic archives of the block chain which can be downloaded from https://snapshot.pocketnet.app/latest.tgz.Be sure to back up your wallet.dat file before attempting loading the blockchain from archive.
The Linux bash shell commands below will delete the existing blockchain data on disk, download the blockchain archive, and extract it to the default location:

[source]
----
cd ~/.pocketcoin
rm -r blocks
rm -r chainstate
rm -r indexes
rm -r pocketdb
wget https://snapshot.pocketnet.app/latest.tgz
tar -xzvf latest.tgz -C ./
