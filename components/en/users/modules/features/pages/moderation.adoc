NEW JURY SYSTEM (IN DEVELOPMENT)
We are assuming that there are two levels of high reputation users: SuperTops (rep>1K and more than 1 year on the platform) and Mods. 

Module 1: Flags
We create a special transaction called Flag a user. Tops and Mods can flag any user. Flag has to specify one of the following reasons:

Pornography or Pedophilia
Direct Threat of Violence
Promotion of illegal narcotics

Also, a flag contains the specific illegal post or comment of the user.

Module 2: Jury
When there are more than X flags for user in Y blocks, we use the hash of the previous block to run a lottery on the blockchain. Lottery chooses N mods with public addresses closest to the hash of the previous block. We also set a quorum L<N, where L is enough Mods in the jury to render a decision.
*Note that for trial users numbers X and N will be significantly lower and they will be banned much quicker.

Each Mod that is N mods chosen receives a notification about being selected for a jury on the special user. They click on notification and it opens in a special window the illegal post or comment, along with the reason the user was flagged. Mod has two choices Confirm Flag   or No Offense

If all mods agree on Confirm Flag, the user gets a 4 week ban from posting, all nodes should reject transactions from user.

After three months, the user can be subject to another jury (second jury cannot contain any members from the first one) and if “convicted” the second time, a forever ban is instituted. The ban does not affect the PKOIN in the account, only social network privileges.

*for trial accounts, the first conviction will ban forever
If at least one Mod disagrees, then nothing happens and the user is immune from jury for three months.
If a Mod votes 5 times in a row or 5 times  within 1 month as a single dissenting voice, the Mod loses Mod privileges. *yes, this is controversial, but the rules of Bastyon are very simple and likelihood of being a single dissenting voice of integrity are very low for 5 votes.
*we an add other rules for Mod who abuses moderation with clever strategies, to prevent such gaming
What we need on the node:
1.	A new status Mod (to be discussed below)
2.	Flag transaction
3.	Constant accounting of flags to see when a limit has been breached to call a jury
4.	Algorithm to select mods based on the hash of the previous block (need to consider reorgs)
5.	Counter to count the number of mods who voted until reaches quorum, then stop
6.	API to send notifications to mods that they were selected
7.	Accounting of previous trials and three month immunity or alternatively a four week ban
8.	Enforcement of list of forever banned accounts
What we need on the Front End:
1.	Flag transaction send
2.	Notifications to Mods 
3.	A window to vote
4.	Messages regarding the statuses of your case


Module 3: Appointments
Where do Moderators come from? Total # of moderators=# of SuperTops * 3 
1/3 SuperTops (rep>1K and more than 2 years on the platform) 
1/3 appointed by bloggers, proportional to active followers (defined by number of followers who commented at least 3 posts in the last 3 months)
1/3 appointed nodes (addresses) which held PKOIN more than 1 year
*bloggers and nodes have a way to track what their appontees
